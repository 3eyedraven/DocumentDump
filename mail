Good Afternoon Everyone!

More than three years it's been since I stepped on that hillside parking and looked at Jesper for the first time. I remember the couches in Hinjewadi library, almost all of the library trips ended in a mid-day nap. I remember the lady in the vendor shop at cognizant circle, she used to put so much spices in "kadhai paneer" that it'd make my eyes watery. I remember all those gossips at eat-street, club hunting, sobering up a drunk friend and most importantly, the  tremendous fun we had throughout the whole time.

But again, they say, "All good things come to an end". As we progress into the third year of the global pandemic, the journey with Capgemini comes to an end for me. It's been a crazy ride, and after about 32 months when it's finally time to get down at my station, I look back and I see that I'm leaving with a bagful of memories and honestly, I can't remember a bad one - all thanks to you, and many more amazing people. You are the ones who kept the fire of positivity rising, and I hope you'll keep on doing that for years to come, no matter where you go.

I thank you from the bottom of my heart, for coming with me this far and I hope our paths cross again in the future.

Till then take care, stay safe and most importantly, keep being amazing!
